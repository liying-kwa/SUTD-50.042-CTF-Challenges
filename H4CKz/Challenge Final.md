**MESSAGE CLASSIFICATION**: Top Secret

**FEB 30, 2020**

**ATTN**: `Padding==`ton Bear 007

**ATTACHMENT CHECKSUM (MD5)**: 55261c371ddfba51a1d62b0d4d05a485 (ZIP folder)

Agent,

You are among a select group chosen to carry out this perilous assignment. We have acquired a document containing an encrypted key intercepted from the mission target. Our intel suggested that the key needs to be decrypted first, and forensics determined the encryption scheme to mostly likely be RSA. You will be maintaining a cover of a typical Singaporean civilian.

Before you begin, please review the attached ZIP folder containing the Cybersecurity Act of Singapore. Intel suggested that the mission target is part of law enforcement and has been made aware of our surveillance on their movements. It would be wise for you to abide by the law as much as possible so as to not arouse any suspicion. The checksum is computed for the ZIP folder, and is provided at the start of this brief.

The following contains the profile of the mission target which should aid in your mission greatly:

[REDACTED] *is a born Singaporean, suspected of aiding recent state-funded Russian hacking attacks on Singapore’s health sector, leaking confidential health reports to nefarious sources. For the latest attack, the phrase **“Доверяй, но проверяй”** was left behind in the system. Forensics traced the source location of this attack to **the 64th Little Khrushovian Base in Russia**. Post attack analysis showed that the target’s typical mode of **information obfuscation is through XOR operations** and has always seemed to **involve four manipulated files**.* `==`


The following is the key to be decrypted:
ciphertext:

*We will rendezvous again once you have decrypted the key.
