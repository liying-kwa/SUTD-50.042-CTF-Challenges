1. Find b in DHKE protocol (optional)
- Optional because shared key can still be found using B^a = A^b
- See code implementation in solution.py


2. Figure out 80 bit key for present
- Is actually the key found in the previous part
- Confirmed to be 80 bits with key.bit_length()
- Write to key file 'key.txt'


3. Decrypt the encrypted conversation
- Decrypt the conversation using ecb.py and present.py from Lab 4
- The decrypted message is as shown:

=========================================================
Alice: NOW OUR CONVERSATION IS ENCRYPTED
Bob: YES *EVIL LAUGH*
Bob: Hey, wanna hear a secret?
Alice: What is it?
Bob: “KNKQIVCCFOFOXPGLNSADFABIASTS-FDP(1985)”
Alice: Did we encrypt it?
Bob: Yes we did, don’t forget.
Alice: Anyways... I am hungry
Bob: CAKEISGOOD
Alice: Ah yes, CAKEISGOOD indeed. Let us end our totally meaningful confidential conversation here
Bob: Ok. See you!
===========================================================


4. Decrypt the code
- “KNKQIVCCFOFOXPGLNSADFABIASTS-FDP(1985)” is the code
- Ignore the (1985)
- CAKEISGOOD is in capital letters, so probably the key to the cipher
- Cipher used is learnt in week 1, Vigenere cipher takes in a plaintext and word key and outputs a ciphertext in same english letters
- Decrypt using Vigenere cipher, using CAKEISGOOD as key
- ANSWER: INAMADWORLDONLYTHEMADARESANE-RAN(1985)
