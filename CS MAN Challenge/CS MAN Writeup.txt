After logging in, entering any password gives an error = H(entered password) XOR H(actual password) in the console, with MD5 as the hash function
Entered password = abcdefghij
H(entered password) = a925576942e94b2ef57a066101b48876
Error returned = f6689b52184e2ef8e8f921bfb93647ef

Rearraging, Error XOR H(entered password) = H(actual password), which results in
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

Searching through an online database of hashes https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash, the unhashed password was found
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99:password

Entering password brought us to a new screen with a blank textbox to submit
Submitting any text gives a ciphertext, and submitting again gives the same message from the ciphertext but encoded with a different cipher key

The first two ciphertext given were

Using frequency analysis on the latter (the one that starts with zlv, zhh...), the following text was obtained, with the following substituion key (in alphabetical order)
text = ART, ALL MY LIFE I WANTED TO BE SOMEBODY IMPORTANT. WELL DO IT THEN.ART, IM GOING TO SAVE MONEY SO I DONT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. GREAT. JUST DO IT.ART, I DONT FEEL LICE IVE HAD ENOUGH TRAINING. WHAT DO I DO? YOU JUST DO IT. ART, MY MANAGER DONT GIVE ME NO HELP. WHAT DO I DO? YOU JUST DO IT. ART, YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. I WAS MR.

ART, WHATS THE PRIMARY DIFFERENKE BETWEEN WINNERS AND LOSERS THE WINNERS DO IT. THEY DO IT, AND DO IT, AND DO IT, AND DO IT, UNTIL THE JOB GETS DONE. AND THEN THEY TALC ABOUT HOW GREAT IT IS TO HAVE FINALLY HAVE AKHIEVED SOMETHING YOU NEED. AND HOW GLAD THEY ARE THAT THEY DIDNT QUIT LICE EVERYBODY ELSE. AND HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO FINALLY BE SOMEBODY THEYRE PROUD OF. AND MACE A DIFFERENKE WITH THEIR LIFE.

Looking at the inaccuracies in the text, the frequency analysis mis-judged the plaintext letters C and K, thus swapping them gave:
Key = ZMRSPTUWOXJHBNQIFLCVGDEAYK
