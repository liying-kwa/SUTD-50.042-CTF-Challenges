We were given the following chat logs:

We could then recognise that there were four messages being sent (encoded in hex):

msg1 -> 1a1a1b1e4c1c555525480c520e1e010d11015359061b001345094a0803080d4b434f221a491717
msg2 -> 180a0d54002e071c0645
msg3 -> 180a0d54002000005247160b16570c131145004f490a550c42
msg4 -> 1a1a1b1e4c1c55553a410b130d164d0613

We realised that the crib-drag method could be used to solve for the plaintext. The idea is that if the same OTP is used to encrypt two messages, then taking the XOR
of the two ciphertexts would give us the XOR result between the two plaintexts. We could then choose words that we believed were in one of the two plaintexts, and 
XOR that with the XOR result between the plaintexts. We started to XOR our chosen word from position, and checked if there was a human-readable (that made sense) result.
If there was, we would mark that word at that position for the first message, and the result at that position for the second message.
If no human-readable result was found, we then shift the XOR by one position, and try again.

We tried this process with all four messages.

We tried to implement our own Crib-Drag solver, but ultimately we found an online tool that could obtain the same result:
https://lzutao.github.io/cribdrag/

Using the online tool, we decrypted the four messages to be as follows (in order):
msg1 -> Purple: Who killed you re
msg2 -> Red: White
msg3 -> Red: You guys are so dumb
msg4 -> Purple: hahaha gg

From this, we know that White is one of the imposters.

Finding the other imposter was just a matter of inference from the chat logs. We can see that Green clearly states that White is safe, and that he
saw White scan at medbay (which is a visual task). This cannot be the case if White is the imposter. Hence, Green is the other imposter.
