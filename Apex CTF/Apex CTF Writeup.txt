The first message to decode is: IEEOMPUKSOATWUYEEYOMHSHHRLSEYM
We are also given a number: 236514

After some consideration, we realised that the encrypted message could be from a transposition cipher encryption.
Going to a transposition cipher decoder tool, https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher, we could obtain the first message
by using 236514 as the key.

First decoded message: HIPLEASEUSETHEKEYWHOSYOURMOMMY

Hence, it seems as if we have obtained another key: WHOSYOURMOMMY

The next encrypted message that we obtained (in string.printable) was -> :OW+iW-b&VQ6$(HUcqhepd8fficffcrgeof8jfio88pp8ok6gd4
